# Tutorial
GitHub-is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developer. GitHub will require that you make an account to beable to access all the features it has to offer. Once an account is made you will be brought to a homescreen. Jumping straight into it at the top right corner there will be a plus sign that you will want to click it will give you a selection like "New Repositroy" and "Import Repository" click on New Repository. Creating a repository will be like creating a file for ones self and for others who have been granted permission to use depending on whether you put it on public or private based on your own accords. After your repositroy is made you will be brought to the home location for your file itself. GitHub can also be merged with it's partner Git which is similar but its a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers but not limited to just that allowing other changes to be tracked.The two typically go hand in hand. Which it typically does not matter what order you do it but Git can be downloaded and then just accessed when you stumble across an issue. Now to further the tutorial, we will be using a javascript programming software called WebStorm, an IDE that has multiple functions in it that benefits us greatly as a programmer or just during group projects. Webstorm will have to be downloaded which you will easily beable to access the link through there website. Once the download is finished for WebStorm you will press (CTRL+ALT+S) for system preferences and select version control for git. Typically your Git.exe file is already located just hit test to verify that it is. Once you finish that your GitHub and WebStorm accounts now have been synched. With them being synched you can work from either or but once you get more comfortable with WebStorm you will mainly be working from that. You can import your repository files by selecting checkout from version control from GIT or VCS from Webstorm and just copy the URL from your GitHub file. Having those two synced you now have access to all the features, you will beable to clone files from your github or webstorm to ensure you have multiple copies. You can commit changes from both which is basically a save feature for web programming. Push and pull which is basically the transfer or files back and forth between Github and Webstorm in case you are working by yourself or with a group and want to see what changes are being made. Along with having the ability to pull work from them and there files which is called branches where an indvidual made an additional sub file to the master file in github so the work is not so cluttered.A few more small features Webstorm/Git is capable of is merging where you take multiple files and combine them unless you receive a merge conflict error where Git will help you decide what changes will need to be made. The information can easily be fetched similar to pull/push you just have the ability to pull something from your partner. Everything is remote so each individual partner can easily exchanges there changes as they work. Although it may seem like a lot these three version controls have shown the effectiveness of using it towards group projects and even more like business projects and big programming jobs.I hope this made using the three a bit easier.

# Definitions
GIT-A distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development, It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

GITHUB-a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, initiated an acquistion of Github for $7.5billion in June, 2018

Repository-A file location where you ae storing all the files related to your project

Clone-A git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository

Commit-A revision where an individual change to a file( or set of files) is made. It's like when you save a file, except using GIT, everytime you save a file it creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of the changes that are being made and who changes what

Push-A command used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository 

Pull-Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.In its default mode, git pull is shorthand for git fetch followed by git merge FETCH_HEAD.

Branch-A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you intially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically

Merge-A command that lets you take independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch

Merge Conflict-Happens when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge

Fetch- Downloads commits, files and refs from a remote to repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on

Remote-A common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
